# GraphRAG-Pipeline
A Repository for the Petagraph GraphRAG Pipeline project





Organizing a GitHub repository for a web service project is essential to ensure clarity, maintainability, and scalability. Below is a recommended structure that follows best practices:

1. Top-Level Directory Structure
This structure separates concerns and keeps your project organized:

bash
```
Copy code
/project-root
├── /app/                 # Application code (main services)
├── /config/              # Configuration files (e.g., environment, logging)
├── /docs/                # Documentation for the project
├── /public/              # Static files (e.g., images, HTML, CSS for the frontend)
├── /scripts/             # Utility scripts for setup, deployment, or CI/CD
├── /tests/               # Test files (unit, integration, etc.)
├── .env                  # Environment variables (keep this out of version control or use .env.sample)
├── .gitignore            # Files and directories to ignore in version control
├── Dockerfile            # Docker configuration for containerization
├── docker-compose.yml    # Docker Compose file for multi-container setups
├── LICENSE               # License information
├── README.md             # Project overview, installation, and usage guide
├── requirements.txt      # Dependencies for Python projects (or package.json for Node.js)
└── setup.py              # If it's a Python package, or other package setup
2. Directory Breakdown
/app/
```
Contains the core code of your web service. This could have subdirectories to handle different services or components:

Backend: If you’re building an API service.
/api/
/routes/: Contains the route handlers (controllers).
/models/: Database models or schema definitions.
/services/: Business logic, services, etc.
/utils/: Utility functions or helpers.
/middleware/: Custom middleware (e.g., authentication, logging).
Frontend: If you also have a frontend.
/components/: React/Vue components.
/views/: Page-level components or templates.
/assets/: Images, fonts, etc.
/config/

Holds configuration settings. You can organize files for different environments:

config.yaml or config.js: Configuration values like API keys, database connections, etc.
development.config, production.config: Environment-specific settings.
/docs/

Documentation related to the project:

API Documentation: Use tools like Swagger or Postman to document endpoints.
Project Overview: Detailed description of the project's purpose, architecture, etc.
Developer Guide: For people who want to contribute to the codebase.
User Guide: If end-users need documentation to interact with the service.
/public/

Holds static assets for your service, such as:

HTML/CSS/JavaScript files: For the frontend.
Images, fonts: Anything that’s publicly served.
/scripts/

Utility scripts for:

Deployment: Scripts for deploying to cloud services or CI/CD pipelines.
Database Migration: If your service requires database migrations.
Setup: Initial setup scripts, for example, to install dependencies, generate tokens, etc.
/tests/

Test cases for your project:

/unit/: Unit tests for individual components.
/integration/: Tests that check how components interact.
/e2e/: End-to-end tests simulating real-world user interactions.
Consider adding a testing framework like pytest (Python) or Jest (Node.js).

3. Other Essential Files
.gitignore

Specify which files and directories should not be tracked by Git. For example:

bash
Copy code
node_modules/
__pycache__/
.env
*.log
.env and .env.sample

Store sensitive configuration (e.g., API keys, DB credentials) in a .env file, and keep a .env.sample for reference.

README.md

This is the first point of contact for users or contributors. Include:

Project overview.
How to install and run the service.
Basic usage and example commands.
How to contribute (if open source).
LICENSE

Include a license to define the legal use of your code. If unsure, use a permissive license like MIT or Apache.

Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml

For containerizing your service:

Dockerfile: Defines the image for your app (dependencies, environment).
docker-compose.yml: If you have multiple services (e.g., web app, database).
4. Branching and Versioning
Follow a Git branching strategy such as:

Main: Stable, production-ready code.
Develop: Integration branch for the next release.
Feature Branches: For individual features or tasks (feature/your-feature).
Hotfix: For quick fixes to the production code.
5. GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
Use GitHub Actions to automate testing, building, and deploying your web service. Define workflows in .github/workflows/.

By following this structure, your project will be easy to navigate, and other contributors or developers will understand where to find relevant parts of your codebase.
